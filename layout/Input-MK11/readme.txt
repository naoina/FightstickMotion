G'Day...
At this time I can not work out how to customise the input history correctly.

So you need to copy these images into the "layout\inputhistory" dir
OVERWRITE any files you have.

Then also delete from that dir button 9 and 10.

Load the app as before, then on the default loaded screen set your 8 buttons you have to go in order..
1,2,3,4
5,6,7,8

Do not worry about the movment buttons.

Now go to custom and load the history thing and eveything should be good!
